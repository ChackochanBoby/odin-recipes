    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Grilled chicken marinade is the secret to transforming a simple chicken dish into a flavorful feast. This
        easy-to-make marinade infuses the meat with a burst of flavors, ensuring every bite is juicy and delicious. A
        perfect balance of olive oil, fresh lemon juice, garlic, and a blend of herbs and spices like rosemary, thyme,
        paprika, and black pepper, works wonders to tenderize the chicken while adding a delightful zest. Whether you're
        preparing for a summer barbecue or a quick weeknight dinner, marinating your chicken for at least a few hours—or
        overnight for the best results—will elevate its taste and tenderness. Explore our collection of grilled chicken
        marinade recipes to find the perfect match for your next grilling adventure.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>¼ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried parsley flakes</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>5 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in yogurt and vinegar. Add onion; cook and stir until golden and tender. Add tomatoes, chile peppers, garlic, and ginger paste. Cook and stir until tomatoes are tender. Season with garam masala, mint, salt, and pepper. Stir in cilantro.</li>
        
        <li>Place chicken into tomato-onion mixture in the skillet. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into meat should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        
        <li>Meanwhile, bring water and rice to a boil in a large pot. Mix in cinnamon stick, bay leaf, green cardamom, and black cardamom. Season with salt. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Discard cinnamon stick, bay leaf, and cardamom.</li>
        
        <li>Spread 1/2 of the cooked rice in the bottom of a large serving dish. Pour chicken mixture on top. Cover with remaining cooked rice. Sprinkle with food coloring; mix to serve.</li>
    </ol>
